I am a doctoral candidate in the [Department of Human Development and Family Science](https://hdfs.vt.edu) at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu), where I also received my M.S. in Human Development in Spring 2024.

My research program focuses on understanding how children’s self-regulation and temperament shape media use across development, with a particular emphasis on early childhood. My ongoing work examines associations between maternal emotion regulation and toddlers’ interactive and non-interactive media use, as well as relations between effortful control and media use during the first five years of life.

Across my doctoral training, I am examining how temperament and self-regulation relate to problematic media use from preschool through middle childhood and adolescence. I am also using person-centered approaches to identify self-regulation profiles among preschool-aged children.

In addition to observational and survey-based research, I am currently involved in the design and evaluation of an AI-supported parent–child shared reading platform aimed at promoting positive parent–child interactions in early childhood.

I am currently a graduate research assistant in the [Cognitive Developmental Science (CoDeS) Lab](https://kchoi.org/) at Virginia Tech.
