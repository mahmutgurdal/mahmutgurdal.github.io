I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Human Development and Family Science](https://hdfs.vt.edu) at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu). I received the M.S. in Human Development from the same department in Spring 2024. My research interests center on understanding the influences of technology on children’s development within the family context.

I am currently focusing on examining various parental factors that contributed to children’s screen use as parents play a seminal role in young children’s media exposure. Specifically, I investigate how both parental and child self-regulation—including emotional, behavioral, and cognitive aspects—affect parental and child screen use as well as how parental and child screen use, in turn, impact their self-regulation skills. Furthermore, I examine the effects of media interactivity, content, and context of screen media use on these relations.

I am currently working as a graduate research assistant supporting for projects within the [Cognitive Developmental Science Lab](https://kchoi.org/) and the [Child Development Center for Learning and Research](https://cdclr.hdfs.vt.edu/research/) at Virginia Tech.
